<h1>Overhead, the Albatross band website.</h1>

The objective of this project was to create a frontend-only webpage for a band. Overhead, the Albatross are a real band from Dublin, Ireland and the user can see their latest music, video, view merchandise and buy tour tickets. It also allows the user to get in contact with the band providing their message via a mail form. It also contains links to the bands music streaming platforms and their social media accounts. This sites is based off a real band with real music and accounts but some content is pure fiction. All content has been researched, collected and edited from many different sites around the World Wide Web.

<h3>UX</h3>
This website is for music fans in general but more targeted towards the bands own fanbase. Its a minilistic design with a clear easy on the eye colour scheme. 

Most of the visitors to this site are probably looking for:
* Check out the latest music content from the band and where they can buy/stream it.
* Find out information on their concert tour and where theyll be.
* Buy and browse the bands available merchandise
* New ways to keep in touch and connect with their favourite music band.

<h5>Wireframes mockups</h5>

Trying to approach the best way to navigate the site and its contents, I started first designing some drafts by hand and then worked with an online application called Sketch. 
My original idea was to have a minimal design with very little scroll required inspired by the website for the band palace - https://www.wearepalace.com/ but after recieving alot of negitive user feedback and facing many problems with navigation and adapting to screen sizes, I decided to redesign the entire website.
The redesign kept most of the orignal content just reorganised into a one page webpage with scroll. I also introduced a full screen video to engage the user and give a feel for what the band produce. I also improved the navigation so its responsive to all screen sizes.

<h3>Features</h3>
My project is broken up into 5 sections - Video, Music, Tour, Merch & Contact. A header is located at the top of the page containing the bands name and navigation options between sections.
Each of the sections has content related to its title.
The footer contains important links to bring the visitor to the bands music streaming platforms and also their social media accounts. It also has a credit to the developer who built the website (on large devices).

Responsive - This website has been made responsive so it allows the user to access this page through their mobile, tablet or desktop and have a pleasing user experience each time.

<h4>Existing Features</h4>

* Feature 1 - **Video**
On opening the website yyou are presented with a cinematic full screen video of the bands latest music video below the header section. This is to give a wow factor to the user as it shows the artistic side of the band as the video is very well shot. The video is muted by default and intrigues the user to find out more and interact with the rest of the website.
* Feature 2 - **Latest & Music**
The Latest & Music section contains details of the bands latest album and is also where the user can listen to a sample  of the band's latest music from spotify. It also contains links to the bands profiles on the major streaming platforms were you can listen to the full catalog of the bands music.
* Feature 3 - **Tour**
This section is made up of a table list of tour dates for the band, which include the date of the concert, the venue and the location. Their is also a button link to the ticket vendors website if tickets still available.
* Feature 4 - **Merch**
This section contains a selection of merchandise, fans can purchase from an outsourced vender. If the user selects the button add to cart they will be brought to the corresponding items page on the third party site.
* Feature 5 - **Contact**
The Contact section is a contact form where the user can get in direct touch to the band for collaboration or any other queries.

<h4>Features Left to Implement</h4>  
Since this project required only to use html and css, some features lack full functionality. In the future, I would like to improve and add further features to this website, such as:

* An **improved merchandise store** - I only implemented a sample of what the merchandise store could look like but this could be developed further to include more merchandise and to make purchases on site rather than linking to external stores.

* A **News/social media feed section** - As social media is integral to a band's popularity and success, I would like to provide a section with news/pictures/tweets etc from the bands social media feeds.

* **Improved design** adapted to specific devices: As a challenge to learn more about design, this site could always be improved. Typography types, sizes and colors as the same applied to backgrounds and other elements are qualities that display in different ways in different devices. Also the responsive design and the breakpoints in media queries are always changing with the new devices releases, so yes, this all could be a future implementation to keep in mind.

<h3>Technologies</h3>

Brief overview of the languages, frameworks, and other tools I've used on this project:

**HTML5**  Markup language as the shell of the site.

**CSS3** Cascading Style Sheets as the design of the site.

**Bootstrap** Bootstrap allows for a responsive layout across various platforms.

**Cloud9** Code editor I used to write the HTML and CSS.

<h3>Testing</h3>
I thoroughly tested the website myself across mustiple devices and screen sizes. I also created a [bug sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t0RJYIa05fQPg7npV4wcCnZX6XM8K-HwhLFWNpmBS6I/edit?usp=sharing) and friend/family to test and write out anything they didnt like or which didnt work as I think its good to get a second eye/opinion. I have creditials to https://www.browserstack.com/ which allows me to test on real devices/browsers which I dont have physical access to. Broken Line Checker (chrome extension) was used to ensure all links work correctly.

I tested the website across multiple screen sizes and ensured it worked on the major/most popular browsers.

**Some problems faced:**
One issue that took longer to fix that I didnt antisapate was on shorter desktop screen sizes with the footer fixed to the bottom, the main section content would overlap. I then fixed after some online research using flexbox.
I also had problems with the video and its status, O recieved various opinions on whether autoplay and sound should be automatic.
After recieving some conflicting opinions on the original colour scheme I also decided to be less daring and reduced the pallette to a more reserved/accepted tone.

<h3>Deployment</h3>
For this project, local deployment was not required. I've deployed the site using GitHub Pages, and is available here: https://shanenoonan.github.io/milestone1-UserCentric-Band/
