<h1>Overhead, the Albatross band website.</h1>

Overhead, the Albatross are a real band from Dublin, Ireland and the user can review their latest music, buy merchandise and tour tickts. It also allows the user to get in contact with the band providing their feedback via mail form. This site is simulating all the previous features and some of its content are pure fiction. All content has been researched, collected and edited from many different sites around the World Wide Web.

<h3>UX</h3>
This website is for music fans in general but more targeted towards the bands own fanbase. Its a minilistic design with a clear easy on the eye colour scheme. Most of the visitors to this site are probably looking for:

Valuable information about the band that made them dance, sing and feel like no other during a single concert or an event.

New ways to keep in touch with their favourite music band.

Listen to the band's songs easily and without paying for it.

Wireframes mockups:

Trying to approach the best way to navigate the site and its contents, I started first designing some drafts by hand and then worked with an online application.

Features. My project is broken up into 5 distinct pages - Home, Tour, Music and Subscribe & Merch. Across each of these pages they follow a frmat consisting of - A header containing a bands name and navigation options between pages.

A main section the contents related to the page selected.

A footer that shows the fan club address and links the visitor to the band via social media as also to the developer's resume (under construction).

Existing Features Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z ...

Features Left to Implement Since this project required only to use html and css, some features lack full functionality. In the future, I would like to improve and add further features to this website, such as:

An improved merchandise store - I only implemented a sample of what the merchandise store could look like but this could be developed further to include more merchandise and to make purchases on site rather than linking to external stores.

A News/social media feed Section - As social media is integral to a band's popularity and success, I would like to provide a section with news/pictures/tweets etc from the bands social media feeds.

Better design adapted to specific devices: As a challenge to learn more about design, this site could always be improved. Typography types, sizes and colors as the same applied to backgrounds and other elements are qualities that display in different ways in different devices. Also the responsive design and the breakpoints in media queries are always changing with the new devices releases, so yes, this all could be a future implementation to keep in mind.

TECHNOLOGIES Brief overview of the languages, frameworks, and other tools I've used on this project:

HTML5 Markup language as the shell of the site.

CSS3 Cascading Style Sheets as the design of the site.

Bootstrap Bootstrap allows for a responsive layout across various platforms.

Font Awesome 5 Use of social media icons.

Google Fonts Fonts library,free to use, some of which I used in my project.

Hover.css A collection of CSS3 powered hover effects to be applied to links.

Cloud9 Code editor I used to write the HTML and CSS.

Testing Coming for a QA testing background I thoroughly tested every aspect of this site. I wrote testing scenarios in a BBD format for others to test too as I think its good to get a second eye/opinion. I have creditials to https://www.browserstack.com/ which allows me to test on real devices/browsers which I dont have physical access to. Broken Line Checker (chrome extension) was used to ensure all links work correctly.

Example BDD test scenario: Subscribe Page form function : Given I am on the "Subscribe" page Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

Some problems faced: One issue that took longer to fix that I didnt antisapate was on shorter desktop screen sizes with the footer fixed to the bottom, the main section content would overlap. I then fixed after some online research using flexbox.

DEPLOYMENT For this project, local deployment was not required. I've deployed the site using GitHub Pages, and is available here: https://shanenoonan.github.io/milestoneProject1/
